# Harmony Hub: Complete Offline Unbrick, Recovery & Cloud-Free Root Guide

This guide documents the complete hardware and software procedure for recovering a bricked, boot-looping, or factory-reset Logitech Harmony Hub and restoring persistent root SSH access **without requiring the Logitech Cloud, the MyHarmony desktop app, or the Harmony mobile app**.

---

## 0. Overview & Architecture

### The Hardware
- **SoC**: Atheros AR9331 (MIPS 24Kc big-endian, ~400 MHz).
- **RAM**: 64 MB DDR.
- **Flash**: 16 MB SPI Flash.
  - `mtd0`: U-Boot bootloader (`ar7240`).
  - `mtd1`: Kernel image 1 (`0x9f010000`).
  - `mtd2`: Kernel image 2 (`0x9f100000`).
  - `mtd3`: Root filesystem (SquashFS, read-only factory image).
  - `mtd4`: User data partition (`/mnt/data`, JFFS2, read-write overlay).
  - `mtd5`: Cache partition (`/cache`, JFFS2).

### The UnionFS Layer
The Hub boots with a UnionFS overlay where `/` is composed of:
```text
none on / type unionfs (rw,dirs=/mnt/data=rw:/mnt/root=ro)
```
- Any file modified in `/etc`, `/usr`, or `/data` is stored on `/mnt/data`.
- If an init script (such as `/etc/init.d/rcS`) is corrupted, the original untouched factory copy still exists in the read-only SquashFS `/mnt/root/etc/init.d/rcS`.
- The factory reset function simply wipes `/mnt/data`.

### Why the Stock Firmware Blocks Root Without Cloud
When a hub is factory reset, `/data/resources/Context.json` is erased. In this state, Logitech's stock daemon (`luaworks`) on port 8088 rejects all local WebSocket connections with `401 Wrong hubId` because no account or device profile has been loaded yet. 
**With UART hardware access, you can bypass the entire cloud provisioning step** and directly install persistent SSH into the system overlay.

## 1. Complete uboot reset to unbrick the Hub and reconnect to WiFi.  

1. Press the Reset button on the hub while powering on the hub. 
2. The red LED on the front of the hub should blink repeatedly for +-30-60 seconds.
3. This will reset the Hub to its factory default state.
4. Connect the Hub to USB
5. Use the harmony-hub-root project to set WiFi credentials, do not try to root yet

## 2. Hardware Preparation & UART Pinout

### Disassembly
1. Peel back or remove the 2 rubber foot pads on the bottom of the Hub to expose 4 Phillips screws.
2. Remove all 4 screws.
3. The top and bottom plastic shells are held together by perimeter snap clips. Insert a plastic pry tool, guitar pick, or thin spudger into the seam along the rear (near the micro-USB and 3.5mm IR jacks).
4. Pry gently around the edges; the top cover will pop off cleanly.
5. Unscrew the 1 screw holding the PCB in place.
6. Lift the PCB out of the plastic casing.
7. Flip the board over.
8. Look for the J2 header

### UART Pinout
The J2 header is a 10-pin test point header:

```
  [ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 6 ] [ 8 ] [ 10 ]
  [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 5 ] [ 7 ] [ 9 ]
```

| Pin | Label | Description | Connection to USB-UART Adapter |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2** | **RX** | Hub UART Receive | Connect to adapter **TX** |
| **4** | **TX** | Hub UART Transmit | Connect to adapter **RX** |
| **8** | **GND** | Ground | Connect to adapter **GND** |

> [!CAUTION]
> The AR9331 uses **3.3V TTL logic**. Ensure your USB-UART adapter is set to **3.3V** (never 5V). Do not connect VCC; power the Hub normally through its micro-USB port.

### Serial Terminal Settings
- **Baud Rate**: `115200`
- **Data Bits**: `8`
- **Parity**: `None`
- **Stop Bits**: `1`
- **Flow Control**: `None`

---

## 3. Entering Single-User Mode (U-Boot Interruption)

When powered on, U-Boot listens on serial for ~1 second before booting the kernel.

1. Open your serial terminal (PuTTY, Tera Term, or `picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0`).
2. Start spamming the **Enter** key.
3. Plug in the micro-USB power cable.
4. U-Boot will halt autoboot and drop to the command prompt:
   ```text
   ar7240> 
   ```

5. In U-Boot, boot into a single-user root shell with active serial console:
   ```text
   setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 init=/bin/sh
   bootm 0x9f010000
   ```
   *(Note: This does not modify the flash environment; it only applies to the current boot).*

6. Linux will boot directly to a root prompt:
   ```text
   /# 
   ```

## 4. Initializing Filesystems in Single-User Mode

Because `/bin/sh` bypassed `/sbin/init`, standard filesystems must be mounted manually:

```sh
# Mount volatile ramfs and link /tmp
mkdir -p /var/volatile/tmp /var/volatile/run /var/volatile/log
ln -sf /var/volatile/tmp /tmp

# Mount all storage partitions and remount unionfs as read-write
mount -a
mount -o remount,rw /

# Verify write access
mkdir -p /usr/sbin
touch /usr/sbin/test && rm -f /usr/sbin/test
```

---

## 5. Bringing Up Wi-Fi in Single-User Mode

The Wi-Fi kernel modules must be inserted in their exact dependency order:

```sh
D=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)
insmod $D/asf.ko
insmod $D/adf.ko
insmod $D/ath_hal.ko
insmod $D/ath_rate_atheros.ko
insmod $D/ath_dev.ko
insmod $D/umac.ko

# Create the station interface and connect using existing credentials
wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode sta
wpa_supplicant -B -iath0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
udhcpc -i ath0
```

Wait 3–5 seconds. You will see:
```text
Sending select for <Hub_IP>...
Lease of <Hub_IP> obtained, lease time ...
```

---

## 6. Transferring Dropbear SSH Without Cloud

The factory SquashFS on Harmony Hub does not include `dropbear`. We use a tiny 4 KB TCP receiver helper that can be pasted over serial, which then pulls the full 577 KB `dropbearmulti` binary over Wi-Fi in 1 second.

All required tools are stored in [`tools/unbrick_recovery/`](tools/unbrick_recovery):

### Step A: Start the TCP Server on your PC
On your computer (connected to the same Wi-Fi/LAN), run:
```bash
python tools/unbrick_recovery/serve_dropbear.py
```
This prints your PC's IP and begins listening on port `9999`.

### Step B: Create `/tmp/recv` on the Hub
In your serial terminal on the Hub, paste the contents of [`tools/unbrick_recovery/upload_recv.sh`](tools/unbrick_recovery/upload_recv.sh):
*(This script contains 71 lines of `echo -ne "\x..." >> /tmp/recv` and finishes with `chmod +x /tmp/recv`).*

Verify on the Hub:
```sh
ls -l /tmp/recv
# Output should show: 4332 bytes
```

### Step C: Pull `dropbearmulti` over Wi-Fi
On the Hub, run:
```sh
/tmp/recv <YOUR_PC_IP> 9999 > /usr/sbin/dropbearmulti
```
Verify the downloaded binary:
```sh
ls -l /usr/sbin/dropbearmulti
# Output should show: 577296 bytes
```

---

## 7. Installing Dropbear Permanently

Now configure the system so Dropbear starts on every normal boot:

```sh
# 1. Make executable and create symlinks
chmod 755 /usr/sbin/dropbearmulti
ln -sf /usr/sbin/dropbearmulti /usr/sbin/dropbear
ln -sf /usr/sbin/dropbearmulti /usr/sbin/dropbearkey

# 2. Generate RSA host key
mkdir -p /etc/dropbear /root/.ssh
/usr/sbin/dropbearkey -t rsa -f /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key

# 3. Create the boot trigger file
# Stock /etc/init.d/rcS checks: if [ -r /etc/tdeenable -a -x /usr/sbin/dropbear ]; then dropbear; fi
touch /etc/tdeenable

# 4. Install your SSH public key
# Dropbearmulti supports both ED25519 and RSA keys:
echo "<YOUR_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY>" > /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys
cp /etc/dropbear/authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

# 5. (Optional) Set blank root password for direct console access
sed -i 's/^root:[^:]*:/root::/' /etc/passwd

```

---

## 8. Rebooting into Production Multi-User Mode

Reboot the Hub cleanly:
```sh
reboot -f
```

The Hub will now boot normally into `/sbin/init`:

Verify from your PC:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/harmony_owner_ed25519 root@<Hub_IP> "uname -a; id"
```

You now have permanent root SSH access again when recovering from a bricked state.
